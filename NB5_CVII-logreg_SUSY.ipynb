    "## Learning Goals##\n",
    "This notebook will serve as an introduction to the logistic regression as well as the new extremely powerful TensorFlow library for Machine Learning (ML) from Google. We will also learn how to use the versatile Pandas package for handling data. For those of you familiar with the `R` language, the Pandas objects are extremely similar to the dataframe objects in `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview##\n",
    "Throughout, we will work with the [SUSY dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00279/SUSY.csv.gz). It is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html), which is a very comprehensive repository of useful datasets relevant to ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the description of the SUSY dataset we will be playing around with for this notebook:\n",
    ">The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations and contains events with two leptons (electrons or muons). In high energy physics experiments, such as the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the CERN LHC, one major hope is the discovery of new particles. To accomplish this task, physicists attempt to sift through data events and classify them as either a signal of some new physics process or particle, or instead a background event from understood Standard Model processes. Unfortunately we will never know for sure what underlying physical process happened (the only information to which we have access are the final state particles). However, we can attempt to define parts of phase space that will have a high percentage of signal events. Typically this is done by using a series of simple requirements on the kinematic quantities of the final state particles, for example having one or more leptons with large amounts of momentum that is transverse to the beam line ($p_{T}$). Here instead we will use logistic regression in order to attempt to find out the relative probability that an event is from a signal or a background event and rather than using the kinematic quantities of final state particles directly we will use the output of our logistic regression to define a part of phase space that is enriched in signal events. The dataset we are using has the value of 18 kinematic variables (\"features\") of the event. The first 8 features are direct measurements of final state particles, in this case the $p_{T}$, pseudo-rapidity ($\\eta$), and azimuthal angle ($\\phi$) of two leptons in the event and the amount of missing transverse momentum (MET) together with its azimuthal angle. The last ten features are functions of the first 8 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. You can think of them as physicists attempt to use non-linear functions to classify signal and background events and they have been developed with a lot of deep thinking on the part of physicist. There is however, an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks and the dropout algorithm are presented in the original paper to compare the ability of deep-learning to bypass the need of using such high level features. We will also explore this topic in later notebooks. The dataset consists of 5 million events, the first 4,500,000 of which we will use for training the model and the last 500,000 examples will be used as a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comes from this interesting paper by the UCI group: <cite> P. Baldi, P. Sadowski, and D. Whiteson. \"Searching for Exotic Particles in High-energy Physics with Deep Learning.\" Nature Communications 5 (July 2, 2014)</cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical data/Classification Tasks ##\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have largely focused on supervised learning tasks such as linear regression, where the goal is to make predictions about continuous labels. Often, we are also interested in classification tasks -- where the goal is to assign samples to categories. The training data consists of a set of features and discrete labels. This type of data is called categorical data (the data comes in different categories). \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we will focus on a binary classification task. In the SUSY dataset, the goal is to decide whether a data point represents signal \"potential collision\"- labeled 1, or \"background\"(Standard Model processes which produce final states with similar constituents as SUSY processes) - labeled 0. This is done by looking at 18 features - the first 8 of which are \"low-level\" features that can be directly measured and the last 10 features are \"higher-order\" features constructed using physics intuition. In more detail:\n",
    ">The first column is the class label (1 for signal, 0 for background), followed by the 18 features (8 low-level features then 10 high-level features):: lepton 1 pT, lepton 1 eta, lepton 1 phi, lepton 2 pT, lepton 2 eta, lepton 2 phi, missing energy magnitude, missing energy phi, MET_rel, axial MET, M_R, M_TR_2, R, MT2, S_R, M_Delta_R, dPhi_r_b, cos(theta_r1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to use either the first 8 features or the full 18 features to predict whether an event is signal or background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression##\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best understood and canonical methods for performing such a task is Logistic Regression. We will see that a deep understanding of Logistic regression will introduce us to many of the ideas and techniques at the forefront of modern Machine Learning. In Logistic regression, each set of features $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is associated with a category $C_i\\in\\{1,0\\}$, with $i=1\\ldots n$. It is helpful to re-define $\\mathbf{x}$ to be an extended vector $\\mathbf{x}\\rightarrow (1,\\mathbf{x})$ (which just accounts for an intercept, see Sec. VI of the review). Then, the Likelihood function for Logistic regression is given by the sigmoid function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(c_i=1)=1-P(c_i=0)= {1 \\over 1+ e^{-\\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ are the weights that define the logistic regression. Notice that this is just the Fermi function with $\\beta E=-\\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Sec. VI of the review, we will maximize the Log-likelihood of the observed data. Let us define the function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(a)={1 \\over 1+ e^{-a}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Notice that the derivative with respect to $a$ is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{df \\over da}= f(1-f).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $f_i \\equiv f(\\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i)$. Then, the Likelihood of the data $\\{ \\mathbf{x}_i, C_i \\}$ is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(Data|\\mathbf{x})= \\prod_{i=1}^n f_i^{C_i}(1-f_i)^{1-C_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and the log-likelihood is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log{P(Data|\\mathbf{w})}= \\sum_{i=1}^n C_i \\log f_i + (1-C_i)\\log(1-f_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative of the log-likelihood gives us the cross-entropy error function\n",
    "$$\n",

    "In other words, the gradient points in the sum of training example directions weighted by the difference between the true label and the probability of predicting that label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the MLE Estimate ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is the same as minimizing the cross-entropy. There is no closed form expression for this. One strategy is to start with an arbitrary $\\mathbf{w}$ and then update our estimate based on our error function. In particular, we would like to nudge $\\mathbf{w}$ in the direction where the error is decreasing the fastest. This is the idea behind gradient descent. Furthermore, we can show that the cross-entropy error function used in logistic regression has a unique minimum. Thus, we can perform this procedure with relative ease (However, as a word of caution, note there is a generic instability in the MLE procedure for linearly separable data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, one nice method for doing this is the <i> Newton-Raphson </i> method. In this method, we iteratively calculate the gradient \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w}^{new} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{w}^{old} - \\mathbf{H}^{-1} \\nabla E(\\mathbf{w}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{H}$ is the Hessian matrix which is the second derivative of the energy function. For OLS linear regression, one can show that this procedure yields the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Exercise: </b> Show that for OLS Linear regression the formula above produces right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, there are a number of generalizations of this idea that have been proposed. We will refer to these kinds of methods as generalized gradient descent methods and discuss them extensively in what follows.\n",
